## Lua Kenai

**Front-end Dev / Artist / Digital Crafstman**
I am an indie front-end dev who is also an artist!
A lot of how I learned how to code was to make applications or websites for my own brand/business (Fraymotiff).
I have a degree in Art Bachelor and am taking classes of the Computer Science degree in the same university I got my fisrt degree (UFRGS) and plan to get in the full course soon.
